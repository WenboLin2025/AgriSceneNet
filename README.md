# Deep Learning for Scene Understanding in Plant Phenotyping and Precision Agriculture

## Overview

Scene understanding is a critical enabler in plant phenotyping and precision agriculture, aiming to automate the extraction of meaningful information from visual data to enhance crop monitoring, yield prediction, and resource optimization. Traditional computer vision approaches, such as handcrafted feature extraction and classical machine learning, have laid the groundwork for scene analysis but suffer from scalability issues, limited adaptability to dynamic agricultural environments, and sensitivity to noise, occlusions, or incomplete data.

To address these challenges, we propose **Scene Representation Network (SR-Net)** integrated with **Adaptive Relational Scene Optimization (ARSO)**, a novel framework designed for robust and scalable scene understanding. 

## Key Features

- **SR-Net:** A hybrid multi-scale feature extraction pipeline with graph-based relational reasoning for effective modeling of semantic relationships and hierarchical scene representations.
- **ARSO:** Enhances scene understanding with:
  - Domain-aware regularization
  - Dynamic object-relationship sampling
  - Multi-scale context augmentation
- **Robustness:** Designed to handle real-world agricultural complexities such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and incomplete data.
- **Scalability:** Adaptable to different crop types, field conditions, and imaging modalities.

This project represents a significant advancement in leveraging deep learning for agricultural scene understanding, paving the way for intelligent automation in **precision agriculture**.
